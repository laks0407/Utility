# How It Addresses A Problem
As an undergraduate student in university, I often find my mind all over the place. At any given time, I feel like I'm opening up my laptop to a hundred files all unorganized and hazily sprawled across my desktop. 

Besides the obvious overstimulation, this kind of clutter makes it difficult to be productive. Which is why, from time to time, I  find myself manually going through my device sorting everything that needs to be sorted and deleting what needs to be deleted. This process is awful! It takes up way too much time that can be better spent.

So I thought I'd automate it!

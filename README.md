An automated desktop management tool!

**The problem ü§ï**
As a software engineer in uni, oftentimes I find my mind all over the place. At any given time, I can open my laptop to a hundred files all unorganized and hazily sprawled on my desktop. Besides the obvious overstimulation, this kind of clutter makes it difficult to be productive. As a result, I usually find myself manually going through my device once every few months sorting everything that needs to be sorted and deleting what needs to be deleted. This process is awful! It takes up way too much time.

So I thought I'd automate it!
